Oddetect-project-gogoplodeske created by Ghadeer.

A user interface which specify when and where in the image to visualize tracks of passing by objects under a surveillance camera. 

The aim and motivation of such visualization are to understand and figure how to define and build a computer vision model or machine learning model to detect odd behaviours(e.g. illegal attacks or dangerous events).

Running the interface is by running tracking.py.

The loaded tracks in the image is readen by the data  records in the csv.files which are provided in huji2.1 directory which can be 
obtained by unziping huiji2.zip. 
The user can enter the following inputs in the interface: 
1) From which hour to which hour to display the tracks.
2) From which date (day/month/year) to which date to display the tracks.
3) An area in the image: To display the tracks on this area.

Here are run examples of  the application: 
In the right is the user interface (the inputs) and in the left is the output(tracks display according to the input).
